/*
 * REQUIRED COVERAGE, checked in code (ADR 0012's rule applied to the advice).
 *
 * The prompt asks for a high-priority action wherever the title, the summary or
 * the most recent role grades below `strong`, and for one wherever a must-level
 * term lives only on a skills line. Three rewordings of that rule later, a
 * matrix of ten real pairs still had comparisons that met every condition and
 * came back with an empty list: a front-end resume with React and TypeScript
 * already present, judged against a full-stack React posting, ceiling 70, no
 * actions at all — the model had decided the application was hopeless and
 * stopped, which is an editorial call it is not making with the numbers.
 *
 * So the floor is checked here instead of hoped for. What the caller does with
 * a gap is its business: match.ts spends one suggestions call to fill it, and
 * the page tells the user when a list is shorter than it should be.
 *
 * The exemptions are the ones the prompt states, and they are the point — a
 * product manager against a principal-engineer posting is owed nothing, and
 * neither is a resume whose honest ceiling nobody would apply on. Pure.
